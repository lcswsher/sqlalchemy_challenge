### Step 1 - Climate Analysis and Exploration

* Precipitation Analysis - 12 months of precipitation data  (08/24/2016 through 08/23/2017)

* Pandas plot chart of summary statistics for the precipitation data.
*  Station Analysis 
  * Query to calculate the total number of stations.
  * Query designed to identify the most active stations descending order.
* Histogram plot the results as a histogram with `bins=12`.

### Step 2 - Climate App

* Flask API design based on the queries for the following Available Routes:
* Precipitation data by date
* List of stations by name
* List of temperature observations for station USC00519281 for dates 08/24/2016 - 08/23/2017
* Min, Max, Avg Temperatures by Start Date
* Min, Max, Avg Temperatures by Start and End Dates.

### Bonus: Other Recommended Analyses

#### Temperature Analysis I & II

* Plot the min, avg, and max temperature from your previous query as a bar chart.


#### Daily Rainfall Average

* Use Pandas to plot an area plot (`stacked=False`) for the daily normals.
